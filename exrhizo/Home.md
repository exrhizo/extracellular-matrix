Hi it's Alex,

I like building things and exploring psychology.

As a software engineer, I like working with end users. At YouTube I worked on internal analytics, and I've developed video infrastructure at a yoga startup. Now, I'm freelancing a React dashboard and iterating on video chat.

As a facilitator and consciousness dilettante, having experienced identity's remappable fluidity, I'm curious about how our culture undergirds somatic, emotional and cognitive subjectivity. From that perspective, how can we play with the background from which our emotions arise. On a personal level, it's the question of how it can all hurt less and feel better.
