# Multiscale

The explanations and descriptions of quantum mechanics give way to new patterns and structures at the scale of atoms. For atoms, the explanations determine the ground of biochemistry, but again the methods of science and understanding are rewritten anew for ecosystems. The human spirit, the brain and life are described in cognitive science and literature. The life of the social assemblage, requires it's own descriptions and explanations. As human beings, we use our local metaphors, but to be truly effective, are strategies must operate across multiple scales simultaneously. Fortunately, the science of complexity has begun to mature and it's toolset can help us to act with effective strategy to realize a deeper and fuller good.
