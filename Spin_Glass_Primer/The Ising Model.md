When a ferromagnet is heated above its curie temperature, it demagnetizes. The Ising model is a formalization of this process. Above the [[Critical Point]], the micro state magnetic poles are fluctuating and in the macro state, they don't align on net. Below the critical point, the poles can freeze into a coherent average direction and the macro behavior is of a familiar magnet.

A related formalization is the [[Ising Problem]], where the coupled poles are arranged on an arbitrary graph, rather than a lattice. Researchers have created solutions for this using non-linear optical [[Wave Computing]], which could shine light on the nature of [[Consciousness]].

The Ising model is useful for exploring the intuition, but in everyday life we more often find condensed matter phases transitions. For example in H2O, as it changes from ice to water to steam.
