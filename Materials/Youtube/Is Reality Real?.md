- Degrees of freedom you are using to explain sensory data
	- #kl-divergence
- Evidence = accuracy - complexity
- Talking about adding the hypothesis of their being agents like me



[45:34](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6eJ44Jq_pw#t=2734.165984066757) Chris: Put into active inference langauge
- If I see something on my #markov-blanket
	- My interface with the world
- Did I do that? or did the world do it?
	- Did the world do that in response to something I did? Or just do it?
- Babbling #baby
	- Does my action effect
	- Enormous representational capacity
		- A memory to draw inference about correlation



[48:14](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=J6eJ44Jq_pw#t=2894.389368131607) Mike: How many agents and where is the border and how do you model

- short range inhibition - long range activation
- "I am going to make the axis"
- feedback loops are right at the begining
- Cells babbling
	- Put a cell into a dish
	- Cell is constantly probing it's environment
	- Gene expression is never still, all the genes are going up and down in ranges;
	- speculative
		- metabolically; physiologically
	- Find things to draw boundaries
