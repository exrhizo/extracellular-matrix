> __Crossing at a ford__ means, for example, crossing the sea at a strait, or crossing over a hundred miles of broad sea at a crossing place. I believe this __crossing at a ford __occurs often in a person's lifetime. It means setting sail even though your friends stay in harbour,  knowing the route, knowing the soundness of your ship and the favour of the day.
